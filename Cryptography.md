# Cryptanalysis Tools

## Classical

* [GCHQ CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef) - The Cyber Swiss Army Knife - a web app for encryption, encoding, compression and data analysis. Web-based tool for general cypher processing, amongst many other features. Simple programming via drag-and-drop of components.

* [Cryptool](https://www.cryptool.org) - Classical and modern cryptography implementations, intended as a learning platform to experiment with cryptography. Includes two Windows-only versions, a Java version, and an online tool. Includes descriptions of 

* [EverCrack](http://evercrack.sourceforge.net/) - EverCrack performs cryptanalysis on mono-alphabetic substitution and transposition ciphers. Windows, Linux, and online versions.

* [Ganzua](http://ganzua.sourceforge.net/en/) - Ganz√∫a is a cryptanalysis tool for monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic ciphers that can work with almost any set of characters. Cross-platform (Java).

* [CryptoCrack](https://sites.google.com/site/cryptocrackprogram/) - Classical cipher solving program. Windows-only.

* [quipquip](https://quipqiup.com/) - Web-based automatic substitution cipher cracker.

## Modern

* [ciphr](https://github.com/frohoff/ciphr) - a CLI tool for performing and composing encoding, decoding, encryption, decryption, hashing, and other various cryptographic operations on streams of data from the command line.

* [featherduster](https://github.com/nccgroup/featherduster) - Modular framework for cryptanalysis of modern cryptographic implementations.

* [HashPump](https://github.com/bwall/HashPump) - A tool to exploit the hash length extension attack in various hashing algorithms.

CyberChef, Cryptool also do some modern crypto.
